Greetings, fellow early career researchers and open science-curious
friends!

 

In this course, we will introduce you to the world of open science.
Perhaps you are familiar with some of the concepts and ideas of open
science or maybe the open science movement is completely new to you.
Whatever your current understanding is, we believe that what you learn
here will be interesting, thought-provoking and useful in your future
research career. 

 

We are a group of budding researchers and PhD students who first met
during a course focusing on open and collaborative research designed
under the project [[Opening
Doors]{style="color:#1155CC;text-decoration:none;"}](https://openingdoors4phd.eu/project.html)
funded by the Horizon 2020 EU programme for research and innovation. We
felt that what we learned was both fascinating and helpful and believe
that other students should have an opportunity to get familiar with
these concepts too. Hence, we decided to create Agape. Agape means wide
open, as is the open science philosophy and practice we want to promote.
The word *agapē* originates from Greek and means love that is
unconditional, such as our love for science. (Ok maybe not entirely
unconditional, but you get the drift!) Under Agape we aim to share open
science with fellow students and researchers, starting with this course
and continuing with a series of workshops where we can learn, exchange
our opinions and experiences, and together contribute to a better, more
open future. 

 

With this course, Agape would like to open doors for you into the world
of open science and introduce various concepts that we think are crucial
to high quality research and prior to the opening doors project we were
entirely unaware of. Sure, we all heard about scientific integrity and
open access publishing at some point in our studies, but the domain of
open science encompasses a much larger set of ideas and concepts. Given
the sheer extent of open science, this course does not, and could not
cover the whole scope of open science. However, we will provide you with
a scaffolding to understand the core concepts and signpost you to useful
links and resources should you wish to delve deeper and start practising
open science in your own work. 

 

And now, without any further delay, let's quench that thirst for
knowledge! 

 &nbsp;

**Course structure and certificate of completion**

 &nbsp;

The course is structured into chapters that are written to expand on
various topics. We think that the order they follow is logical and the
latter chapters build on knowledge acquired in previous chapters. That
said, you can decide to go through them in whatever order you like by
clicking on different chapters in the menu on the left or to return to
some of them should you find something is not clear or you require a
brief refresher. 

 

At the end of each chapter you will find activities to enhance your
understanding of the concepts introduced in a particular chapter and to
improve your practical knowledge. All chapters except one contain a
short quiz consisting of five questions where you can test your freshly
acquired knowledge. You will see your score immediately and you can save
your high scores if you wish. These scores will be saved in cookies in
your browser and you can delete them by deleting cookies. The quizzes
have no time limit and you have as many attempts to practice as you
want.

 

Once you read all chapters and practise each short quiz you can attempt
the final quiz. If you score 90% or higher a certificate of completion
will be generated for you and you can download it directly. You have
unlimited attempts to successfully complete the final quiz but only
three minutes for each attempt.

 

We know we are by no means perfect. We would love you to share your
opinions, concerns, or feedback about a specific chapter or the course
as a whole. There are two ways to do this. You can either fill in the
survey or use the Disqus widget that you can find at the end of each
chapter to access the forum. In a truly open spirit we will discuss,
collaborate and offer constructive criticism and helpful advice and ask
for the same from you. We will do our best to address your comments or
pass them on to the course admins. We value all suggestions and
feedback, and together we will make this course awesome. We just ask for
a little patience.
